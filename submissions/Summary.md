- Using Viginere cipher with Copperfield Disclosures chapter titles for keys (!!)

## Challenge 6B
- Charles to Ada
- Kaiser discussing with Duleep Singh is worrying 
- If there is conflict on the horizons then Kaiser would benefit greatly from all three sides (Brits, Sihks & Hindus)

- Bullet cases in random arrangement with 200 boxes each full in each crate

## Challenge 7B
- Ada to Charles
- Ada is certain they smuggled something in the shipping containers
- Numerals could be turned upside down and swapped so that the crate with smuggled goods could be hidden
- When Warne inspected them all were full (strange) but Ada knows why
- What could the smuggled goods be?

## Challenge 8A
- Extract from Janus project files
- Control of region relies on indigenous population
- Dont like using rifles with tallow as cows are sacred
- Arming them with guns in mineral oil would work better
- Asking someone? to check to see if they could exploit this

- Ada and Warne were working on decyphering the files
- Wheatestone finished installing his aparatus(!!)

## Challenge 9A
- Janus project file?

- Tensions high - diamond wasn't fully gifted to the queen and instead some resent that it was given up
- If something were to happen to the diamond and hindus seemed responsible the conflict could occur
- Kaiser would benefit from weapons deals
- Kaiser does not think Charles and Palm have considered the safety of the diamond to every eventuality
- When left alone could be suceptible to theivery 

## Challenge 9B
- To Charles and Palm from Ada
- Bullets were packed with extras and one crate contained boxes and the smuggled goods
- Shown by the random then completely organised orientation
- Still dont know the contents (must be something destructive that can be used to steal the diamond)

- Some form of explosive was the smuggled cargo
- Charges are small but can be used to clear the pavillion (to steal the diamond?)

- Detonators were discovered
- Charges could have led to shattering of glass case used to protect diamond and could have harmed people
- Chaos could have been used to steal the diamond
