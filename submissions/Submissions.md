## Challenge 0A
Ada Lovelace and Charles Babbage are two of the most important members of our community.
They featured in the first National Cipher Challenge, and again some years later when we explored their early meeting. In this adventure, we are returning to the end of her life, at least the part recorded in the archives at BOSS headquarters.

I found this story by accident when I was researching the role of the royal family in our national security. Many of them served in the military and are familiar with codes and ciphers, and I wondered how far back that interest went. That was how I stumbled across a note from Prince Albert to Lord Palmerston, and that started me down the rabbit hole that led us here.

I hope you enjoy it as much as I did. We will meet some fascinating new characters on the way, and the story takes a twist or two. Of course, I know how it ends — you don't yet, but if you stick with it, you will. And like me, you will probably learn something on the way.

I have posted a sketch of a bullet that was sent to Ada back in — on the case files page. That was where the story began and what drew Ada in. Take a look and see if you can figure out what it might have meant. It is not a bad place to start.

## Challenge 0B
My dear Palmerston,

I was reluctant to believe that the mystery of the silver bullet could defeat the brilliant minds in your office, but I have come to the conclusion that the singular Miss Warne was correct in her assumption that this particular cipher would defeat us. Her choice of the Countess as her confidante and collaborator was inspired.

The markings on the bullet were clearly significant, though their meaning escaped me entirely until explained. With that knowledge, the accompanying letter commands our attention with its dark allusions to the end of the Empire.

I know that you are tempted to ask the two fearsome ladies to step aside and allow the experts in your department to take on the investigation, but my own experience of my dear wife suggests that once roused, the tigress is unlikely to abandon its meal. And I fear that we will have to stand aside and allow them to continue on their adventure.

It is clear that they have the skills and determination to see this through, and I think we will only obstruct them if we interfere. I trust that you have reached the same conclusion and that I can ask Babbage to convey your thanks and best wishes to them both, in the hope that they can bring a speedy resolution to this troubling matter.

Yours,
Albert

## Challenge 1A - "Curio(u)s"
Caesar: `21`

Mr. Charles Babbage
Dorset Street, Marylebone, London

My dear Charles,

I hope this letter finds you well, and that your campaign to consign the infernal racket of street urchins and their music to the outer reaches of the city has borne some fruit. I am writing to tell you about a curious letter that I received this morning from a woman in America. I took note as she had taken the time to encrypt its contents and had included a puzzle consisting of a short sequence of letters engraved on a bullet.

The circumstances in which this bullet appeared are not fully explained, but her request is that we should consider the engraving and attempt to decipher its meaning. I say "we" and "our," but I must admit that the request was directed to me alone, possibly because, as a woman, I might pay more attention to Miss Warne's letter. It is apparent from the scrawl on the page that she is not highly educated, but she describes herself as a detective and had the wit to recognize that the inscription was significant.

I think I have unlocked its secret, but I would be pleased to hear your thoughts. In particular, is she right in her assumption that the letters signify something to which we should attend? It seems more likely to me that it is merely a curio.

I have missed our discussions, and if I flatter myself that you enjoyed them too, I hope that this curious bullet might give us the excuse that we need to reinstate them. Please do let me know your thoughts.

Yours, as always,
Ada, Countess of Lovelace

## Challenge 1B - "The Cypher(s)"
Substitution: `TUVWXYZABSDEFGHIQKLMNOPCRJ`

Horsley Towers, East Horsley, Surrey, England

My dear Mrs. Lovelace,

I was unsure how to address you, so I hope that this letter finds you, and finds you well. I am writing because I do not know who else to turn to, and I figure that you might be able to help. I am sorry for the trouble I may have caused by ciphering this letter, but I was not sure that you would read a message sent in my hand. Not knowing nothing about me, it seemed more likely you would make the effort if the message was harder to read.

If not, and I am wrong about your interests in codes and ciphers, then perhaps it won’t matter whether you read it or not.

I am a detective in the small town of Erin, New York, and in a recent investigation, I came upon a strangeness that I cannot unpick. I was asked to investigate a break-in at a local warehouse. The hasp had been removed and clumsily replaced, alerting the owner, but nothing seemed to be missing, and the shipping crates remained sealed. Behind them, I found a bullet carrying an unusual inscription, and have included a sketch. It is mighty unusual for a case to be marked in this way, and the letters make no sense to me. I am hoping that you will be able to help interpret them. With luck, that might shed some light on my investigation. Given the bullet was found with a shipment bound for England, there may also be reason for you to be worried, but I most sincerely hope not.

If you have read this far, then please understand how much I appreciate your assistance. I look forward with some eagerness to your reply.

With my gratitude,
Miss Kate Warne

## Challenge 2A - "A letter addressed to Ada"
Substitution: `VMDULCTKBSJARIZQHYPGXOFWNE`

Mrs. Ada Lovelace  
Horsley Towers  
East Horsley  
Surrey  

My dearest Ada,

I was very pleased to receive your letter, and I must apologise that I have taken so long to reply. My duties with regards to the Great Exhibition are absorbing most of my waking hours, leaving little time for other pursuits.

The news that the great Koh-i-Noor diamond is to play a central role in the exhibition has caused considerable consternation among the organisers. The need for security is in some conflict with Her Majesty’s expressed hope that her subjects will be suitably enchanted by the jewel. It is not that impressive, even at close hand, having been cut in the Indian style rather than the faceted cut with which we are more familiar in the West. While large, its failure to catch the light leaves it rather underwhelming, especially placed within a secure enclosure at some distance from the spectators. All the solutions proposed to date have failed to meet royal approval, but I will be discussing the India Pavilion with Prince Albert later today, and I hope that we might settle on a satisfactory solution then. That would free me to spend more time on other interests.

Which brings me to that other rough diamond, Miss Warne. Her letter to you has rather caught my attention. I had not heard that our American cousins had adopted the custom of employing female detectives, and my contacts at Scotland Yard were equally surprised. After a little reflection, I realised that we had no right to be. You have already demonstrated that women have much to offer in fields once reserved to men, and Miss Warne’s letter shows that your example is known across the world. I suspect that we will find many others of your sex following in your footsteps. I look forward to meeting some of them, though perhaps not Miss Warne, who I suspect could not afford the cost of a transatlantic crossing.

To the matter in hand: I am not sure what the markings on the bullet case might mean. It is an unusual set of letters — too long for an acronym, and not a word in any language with which I am familiar. On the other hand, the triple "F" and lack of vowels make it highly unlikely to be an English word encrypted with a substitution or permutation cypher, or even with a combination of these. Context is everything, and it would be very helpful if Miss Warne could provide some. I have no sense of how urgent her enquiry might be, and even the fastest ships take over a week to carry the post, so I think that we should respond quickly. We need to know if there are any other clues that might help us to determine the meaning of the inscription.

Will you be in the city this week? Perhaps we could meet to discuss the wording of our letter.

With my fondest wishes for you and your husband,  
Charles Babbage

## Challenge 2B - "Don't forget the stamp"
Substitution: `STAMPQRUVWXYZBCDEFGHIJKLNO`

Dear Miss Warne,

Thank you for your letter and the intriguing puzzle that you sent me. I have discussed it with my close friend and collaborator, Mr. Charles Babbage, and we are both of the opinion that it is a mystery that demands a little more context if we are to be of any assistance to you. We hope that we are able to help you, but we are somewhat uncertain whether this is something that demands our immediate attention. If so, how do you propose that we should proceed? Even with the improvements in transatlantic traffic, it will take some time to investigate this matter by post, and I am afraid we are still some way from the introduction of the transatlantic telegraph. (Though our friend Mr. Wheatstone is working all hours to hasten that development.) We would be grateful if you could reply with any further information that may help us.

On the matter of the bullet, Mr. Babbage has suggested the possibility that the lettering might be of foreign origin, but we are not aware of a language in which this combination of Latin consonants could signify an expressible word. He suggested also that the characters might be those of an acronym, though the lack of punctuation and the relatively large number of letters makes this, too, unlikely.

We are then brought to the possibility, which I am sure you had in mind, that the text on the case might represent some form of encyphered communication. The shortness of the text presents a significant problem. We are unable to apply our usual techniques of frequency analysis to determine any pattern, and without more context we have no cribs or other clues to its likely meaning. In your letter, you mentioned that the bullet was found in a shipping warehouse near a stack of sealed crates, and that these were bound for England. We would find it most helpful if you could tell us, should you know, the contents of those crates, the individual or corporation to which they belong, and the recipient for whom they are or were intended.

I am sorry it has taken so long for me to reply to you, but Mr. Babbage is heavily involved in the preparations for the international fair to be held later in the year. Given the Prince Consort’s involvement, you can imagine that there are high expectations on all of those who are involved in its delivery. Be assured, however, that we will give our full attention to your reply, and we hope to be able to assist you.

With our very best wishes,  
Ada Lovelace and Charles Babbage

## Challenge 3A - "Roman-a clef?"
Permutation: `ROMANPQSTCVWXYZBLDEFGHIJKU`

My dear Charles,

I hope this letter finds you well rested, for I have the most surprising news. Expecting a reply from Miss Warne, I have been waiting eagerly for the post, in the hope that she would be able to shed more light on the mystery of the silver bullet. What I did not expect, when the doorbell rang, was that Miss Warne herself would be ushered into my morning room! She was somewhat disheveled and close to starving, as if she had walked here, and it took some time for her to recover enough to tell me what she was doing in England.

It appears that she took to heart our concern that this matter would be delayed by the continual exchange of letters, and, discovering that the shipping crates were to be transported to England on the *Pacific*, she made arrangements to travel with the cargo. What arrangements those might have been, she has been too coy to explain. For the moment, I have lodged her with my maid in the attic here at the Towers. The staff have been marvelous, providing her with suitable clothes, and sharing meals. I am not sure how Miss Warne will manage in the longer term, but for now, she is settled, and I think we should concentrate our attention on the information that she has brought with her.

Given that there is a sensitivity to this matter, I would prefer to tell you about it in person. In any case, you may well wish to hear the story from Miss Warne herself, so I propose that we meet here at Horsley at your earliest convenience. In a curious coincidence of timing, Sir Charles is also planning to visit shortly to discuss installing his telegraphic system at our residences in order to speed communication. Perhaps we can arrange matters so that he too can be briefed on the issues in this case.

Speaking of briefing, I think it would be appropriate to keep Lord Palmerston informed of our investigations. Without saying too much at this stage, there are diplomatic issues at play, and he might prefer to lead on these matters. Could I ask you to write to him? You know how he hates to be bothered by women. It might be a good idea to encipher all our communications with his office using our customary transposition cipher. I do not entirely trust the discretion of those in his private office.

With my fondest regards,  
Ada

## Challenge 3B - "A rough diamond"
Permutation: `201354`

My dear Palmerston,

I believe that Prince Albert may already have written to you concerning this matter, and I am a little embarrassed to write this letter at all, but I hope you will understand. I find myself at the mercy of two strong-willed women who assure me that this matter is urgent. You have already been informed about our unexpected guest, Miss Warne, who arrived last week to our astonishment on the steamship Pacific. She is a little coy about how she afforded the journey, and I suspect that she might have been a stowaway. While I am inclined to deal strongly with that matter, the Countess has expressed the equally strong view that we should first address the reasons for Miss Warne’s visit. Given the sensitivity of the matters described below, I think she is probably right.

Miss Warne has determined that the mysterious bullet was manufactured by the Imperial Arms Company, which, as you know, is owned by Julius Kaiser, sponsor of the India Pavilion. The bullet was designed as a novelty item to be distributed at the Exhibition, with the engraved letters denoting the date of the Exhibition opening. The date was encrypted, the cipher in this case being a rather simple Caesar shift. I suppose Kaiser felt that this was rather clever, though it seems an obscure way to market his company. That, perhaps, is a mark of the man's character—he fancies himself the cleverest man in every room. But he is funding the Pavilion, and it is important that we do nothing to offend him.

That discovery might have closed the matter, and I was inclined to ship the somewhat overenthusiastic Miss Warne back to her home in New York. However, the Countess has persuaded me that my initial impressions were prejudicial, and there does seem to be something more to this affair. Miss Warne found the bullet next to a stack of sealed crates marked with the logo of the manufacturer. They had been shipped there from Chicago. The crates contained rifles and ammunition developed by the company for the climate in the subcontinent. The company is hopeful that the British government and the EIC would both be interested in purchasing them. That does explain Herr Kaiser’s interest in the Exhibition. It will act as a marketplace for his new weapons, but also an opportunity to curry favor with the Prince, given his influence with the government. That might improve his chance of winning a contract.

Miss Warne swears that the crates had not been tampered with. The company seals were intact, witnessed by the photographs brought by Miss Warne, and it is not clear how or why one of the bullets should have escaped them. It seems possible that either a rival manufacturer or a criminal gang may have stolen the contents of one or more of the crates, somehow managing to reseal them but leaving this one small clue to their activities. In this, we may have been lucky. If the shipment had appeared to be deficient on arrival at the Exhibition, it would have been difficult to establish that the theft had occurred in the U.S. We might then have been accused of carelessness in our handling of the consignment.

I think it would be in our best interests to examine the company's crates before they leave the ship, which arrived in Liverpool earlier this week. Fortunately, the current dockworkers' strike has delayed unloading, so we should have time to commission a full check of the cargo before it lands. If anything is amiss, then we will be able to assure Mr. Kaiser that the issue arose before the crates reached us.

I am aware of the sensitivities in this matter. With the display of the Koh-i-Noor at its heart, the India Pavilion is very dear to both the Prince and Her Majesty the Queen. It would be most embarrassing if its principal sponsor, Herr Kaiser, should feel that we are not affording him every assistance in his own endeavors.

With my very best wishes,
Babbage

## Challenge 4A - "Imperious"
Permutation: `142053`

Mr. Charles Babbage
Dorset Street, Marylebone
London

My dearest Charles,

Our dinner with Herr Kaiser and his entourage was a success measured in terms of diplomacy, though less so in terms of intelligence. Our guest spoke at length about his ambition to serve Her Majesty, and his interest in the subcontinent was more than evident. It is clear that he is a man of singular will, and his desire to establish Imperial Arms as, in his words, “a truly global company” was asserted more than once. He is a man of many interests, and in that, he reminded me of Wheatstone—though unlike our taciturn friend, Herr Kaiser is rather keen to ensure that everyone knows it. I suspect that whatever our topic had been, he would have made sure to be the principal interlocutor.

I mean no offense, but it is hard in any company for a woman’s voice to be heard, and in his company, I suspect that it is impossible. Fortunately, my dear husband William was able to play his part, and with surprising subtlety, was able to press our questions about the Imperial shipment. William did his very best to interrogate Herr Kaiser along the lines you suggested, with questions concerning the barrel, the firing mechanism, and the cartridge design, and the answers seemed assured and persuasive to all who listened. Yet here, just a few hours later, we find ourselves unable to recall a single innovation in the design.

Herr Kaiser’s enthusiasm cannot be doubted. His commitment to the Exhibition is paralleled only by that of the dear Prince, and I worry that our government might be seduced by his charm and intensity of will. Should they really be considering a transatlantic partnership at the cost of our own manufacturers? That does not seem to me to be in the spirit of the Great Exhibition.

On the issue of security of the shipment, William trod very carefully. He was careful not to indicate any concern on our part, but managed to enquire discreetly about the company’s own arrangements. Herr Kaiser was open in his praise for the port’s authority, but spoke at length, as you might expect, about the superior quality of American security arrangements, hinting that the cargo had been secure throughout its journey. I think we can take it that he was not aware of Kate’s investigations.

Which brings me to my final point. I awoke this morning to find a letter addressed to us both from Miss Warne. She has departed for Liverpool with the intention of examining the Imperial Arms cargo for herself, though I am unsure what she expects to find. Let us hope that she returns with something useful to our deliberations.

With my fondest regards,
Ada

## Challenge 4B - "Counting for the Countess"
Substitution: `CUSTOMNPQRVWXYZALDEFGHIJKB`


For the Attention of Mrs. Ada Lovelace and Mr. Charles Babbage
Horsley Towers, East Horsley
Surrey, England

My dear Countess and Mr. Babbage,

I have completed my investigations at the Imperial Arms customs warehouse and will return forthwith. But knowing just how long that journey may take, and how remarkably swift your Royal Mail can be, I thought it best to send you my report by letter.

My new friends in Liverpool were real helpful and provided me with the shipping papers, although I am not sure how much assistance they will provide. All I can see is that the crates all left the United States together, and each weighed the same, suggesting that nothing had been taken. I find it mighty unlikely that anyone interested in stealing the contents of a single crate would take the trouble to replace them with a carefully calibrated weight of rubble or other nonsense. And in any case, the seal had been replaced—that seems like an awful lot of trouble for a few rifles and boxes of ammunition.

With the crates in storage, the seals have been removed, presumably to allow your customs officials to inspect them, and that gave me an opportunity to examine the contents. It took me a long time to work through them all, but it’s the darnedest thing: there is nothing missing, and I mean nothing—not even a single bullet. And we know that at least one was left on the floor of the warehouse in Erin.

My friends tell me that a Hindu gentleman had been seen in the vicinity of the shed the past night, but I am minded to think that is just scuttlebutt. Folks in Erin talk like that about strangers all the time, and with nothing to connect him to the cargo and no way to track him down, I think we can ignore, if not forget, the gossip.

I hope to be with you again in three days and look forward to discussing this mystery with you then.

Miss Kate Warne

## Challenge 5A - "Stranger, danger?"
Permutation: `435201`

My Dear Charles,

Kate has returned covered in grease and dirt and barely able to talk after her journey. Once she had recovered, and my maid had found her a change of clothing, we discussed her discoveries at length. She is a most thoughtful young woman, and her rough speech and manners disguise a keen eye and a sharp intellect.

She provided me with the following details concerning Herr Kaiser’s arms shipment:

Crate Types:
The shipment is comprised of two styles of crate:

Long and narrow crates, each containing six rifles manufactured by the Imperial Arms Company. The guns are packed in straw and protected with a mineral oil rust inhibitor. Kate noted that she is more used to seeing guns shipped in tallow and, I think in jest, remarked that this was the only new element in the manufacture of the guns. I do not recall this being mentioned by Herr Kaiser, but then it is such a trivial point.
Tea chest-style crates, each containing two hundred boxes of cartridges.
Cartridge Details:
Kate sketched the contents for me, but there is nothing remarkable about them except the quantity. I will show you the sketches when you visit, as they are too large to enclose.

Seals and Inspection:
The seals of several crates had been removed for inspection by the customs officials, and others had been subsequently removed by the warehouse staff at the request of the company. This allowed Kate to inspect all of them. She spent a night removing all the contents and checking them. Each crate contained the same number of boxes, and each box contained the same number of cartridges, protected with a mineral grease (again, in preference to tallow). Each box was full, as was each crate, so I think we can be sure that nothing had been tampered with.

You can reassure Palmerston that there is no reason for concern about the security of the shipment. I understand that it is already on its way to the exhibition, accompanied by staff from Imperial Arms.

The Gentleman in the Vicinity:
I did ask Kate about the gentleman who had been spied in the vicinity of the warehouse, but she had little to add apart from the fact that he wore a peculiar gem in his turban. I believe these are known as sarpechs, and we can take it from this description that he was, in fact, a Sikh, not a Hindu. A peculiarity lay in the fact that the gems adorning it were all black. I do not think she had appreciated the full significance. These decorations are only worn by those of royal descent.
I would think it a mere curiosity were it not for the fact that the Great Diamond will play such a significant role in the exhibition. I know that not all of the Sikhs were in favour of Maharajah Duleep Singh’s magnificent gift to Her Majesty, and while I cannot at present make a connection between the Koh-i-Noor and Herr Kaiser, it must at least be possible that there is one.

May I request that you consult with Palmerston on this matter? Are any of his staff familiar with the gentleman spied in Liverpool? And are the security services confident that the diamond will be safe?

With so many questions arising from Kate’s report, I feel that we ought to take a little more care in our communications from this time on. May I take the liberty of suggesting that your reply should be secured with a Vigenère cipher using my personal key?

I look forward to your reply, as always.

Ada

## Challenge 5B - "Troublemaker"
Vigenere: `ADA`

My Dear Ada,

I am sorry for the delay in my reply. I have found the last few days remarkably busy. Before I could respond to your letter, I was called to Whitehall Place to deal with an incident that had occurred at Kaiser’s lodgings.

A young woman had been apprehended outside the property carrying a large bag in which were found photographic equipment and plates. Not believing her story of being a journalist and recognizing her accent as American, the constable placed her under arrest. Fortunately, recognizing the potential for a diplomatic incident, he transported the suspect to headquarters, whereupon she requested that I should be called.

I am still unclear what prompted Miss Warne in her actions, but she clearly believes that Herr Kaiser has something to hide and apparently took it upon herself to break into his lodge and to take photographs of documents she found there. She apparently borrowed the equipment from Wheatstone, who has been experimenting with faster exposure imaging. What he thought he was doing in assisting the young lady, I am at a loss to explain. Miss Warne seems to possess a charm that is lost on me but which persuades others to join her in her mad adventures.

The delay has been caused in part by the need to process the plates and to consider their contents. Unfortunately, our amateur photographer failed to protect the images, and they were badly overexposed. I suspect she had not realized just how sensitive Wheatstone’s formula is. The only legible part of any of the images was the phrase "Janus Project." According to Miss Warne, this was written on the cover of a file containing encrypted documents, which she had also attempted to copy.

It has taken all my persuasion, and an intervention by Palmerston, to get her released, and I am afraid that the police have confiscated all of the equipment. I foresee a disagreeable conversation with Wheatstone in my near future.

I do not know what we are to make of this. Palmerston has made it clear that Miss Warne cannot be allowed to continue in this irresponsible way. She risks jeopardizing the delicate negotiations between the government and Herr Kaiser’s company. And yet, I think she may be onto something.

I asked Palmerston about the Sikh with the black sarpech, and he immediately knew who I meant. The gentleman in question is a prince and high-ranking official in Duleep Singh’s entourage. He is visiting the Great Exhibition as the official representative of the Maharajah and has been heavily involved in discussions about the display of the diamond. The Maharajah is deeply concerned that the gem should be fully appreciated by Her Majesty’s subjects but shares her concern at our ability to ensure its safety.

Not wishing to stir up more ill feeling over the gift of the diamond, those discussions have been at the highest level, and I was not made aware of them until now. Palmerston was also not aware that the prince had left London, but he was not unduly surprised nor was he alarmed that there might be a connection between the Maharajah and Herr Kaiser, given that the latter is sponsoring the India Pavilion.

While I agree that we need to continue our investigations, can I ask you please to do your very best to tame Miss Warne? The little time I have available is better spent contemplating her discoveries than dealing with the authorities on her behalf.

With my best wishes, as always, to you and your husband,
Babbage

## Challenge 6A - "Re-ordered thoughts"
Vigenere: `DAA`

My dear Charles,

Please accept my sincerest apologies for the trouble caused by your guest. I know that your current travails occupy most of your time, and we are all so very grateful that you have given your time to support Miss Warne.

She is, I will admit, unconventional—at least by the standards of our usual company. You no doubt find her tiresome, with some justification, given the effort you have had to expend in order to extract her from the clutches of our friends at police HQ. If her adventures were purely recreational, then I would share your frustration. But she has fully convinced me that there is something here for us to investigate, and I most urgently beg you to give this matter your attention.

While we do not have the photographic evidence that Miss Warne set out to obtain, she has the most extraordinary gift of being able to recall the images she attempted to record in the most incredible detail. I would not have believed this claim if it were not for the fact that the text she described is clearly encrypted, and I do not believe that she would have been able to invent it.

I have taken the liberty of transcribing the Janus Project document as dictated by Miss Warne and will turn my attention to its decipherment, as I am sure that you are too busy to attend to that matter. Wheatstone will be visiting this afternoon to test our new telegraphic equipment, so I may send you the decryption that way, if that is agreeable to you.

In the meantime, I would be most grateful if you could spare the time to consider the following question: If the Imperial Arms cargo had not been stolen, then where did the bullet come from? I can believe that a few bullets might not be missed in such a large cargo, but Kate is most scrupulous and certain that was not possible. The crates were full.

Did Herr Kaiser not notice, or did he not care? And if opened, why were the crates resealed? Petty thieves are unlikely to take such trouble. Oh, but in rereading that paragraph, a thought has occurred to me. It is too fantastical to share in its infant state, and I will need to ponder it a little before it matures into something worth offering for your consideration.

Let it suffice that I think the answer is not that Herr Kaiser failed to notice or to care, but that he took great pains to ensure that we would not notice and therefore that we would not care. Perhaps I have said enough for you to chance across the same thought. I will be most intrigued to see if you do.

In the meantime, could I ask you to make the following inquiry of your contacts in the Customs and Excise department: How were the crates in the shipment labelled, and how were they inspected?

May I conclude by suggesting that we should increase our security a little? If my suspicions are correct, then Herr Kaiser may be taking an interest in your communications, and it would be a pity to alert him to our concerns. Since the Vigenère cipher continues to resist attack even by you, it should provide a level of secrecy suitable for our purposes.

I suggest that we use the chapter titles from The Copperfield Disclosures for keys, though I would welcome your thoughts on our future arrangements.

Yours excitedly,
Ada

## Challenge 6B - "Witchcraft?"
Vigenere: `SALEM`

My dear Ada,

It is I who should apologise to you. Our guest is certainly trouble, but not more trouble than she is worth, and I share your view that she has cause for her suspicions.

While the discussions between Herr Kaiser and the Prince may well be innocent, the fact that a dealer in armaments is spending such a considerable amount of time and money ingratiating himself with Duleep Singh should concern us. While I do not believe that the Maharajah is interested in stirring conflict, it is my experience that those who benefit most from instability are the merchants of weaponry. It is certainly not in Herr Kaiser’s financial interests to encourage peace.

Even a hint of trouble in the northern territories could lead to pressure on the government to reinforce the existing EIC armies, at great cost to us and enormous gain to him. I am only glad that the discussions are with the Sikh community. They at least pay lip service to Her Majesty’s authority, as evidenced by the gift of the diamond.

If there were any suggestion that Herr Kaiser is engaged in discussions with the Hindu leadership, then I think we would be in a much more dangerous position. Their loyalty is at best precarious, and it would not take much to trigger a war that might be in the interests of the Imperial Arms Manufacturing Company, but it would not be in ours.

I must admit to being curious as to the hints you gave at the end of your last letter concerning your fantastical thought. I cannot claim to have had any insight into the strange matter of the shipment, but I did make the enquiries you requested of me, and so I will close with the answers.

The rifle crates were labelled with letters, while the bullet crates were numbered from I to XXIII. The customs officials called for a random sample to be delivered to the office for inspection, one at a time. Each was opened, inspected, and returned to the floor, and the next was summoned.

In all, the officers inspected seven crates: numbered II, IV, VII, IX, XII, XV, XVIII, and XXII. Each was recorded by the officials as holding two hundred boxes of cartridges, each of which was full, just as reported by Miss Warne.

There was nothing remarkable about the cargo, and the customs officer was happy to release it to the company charged with shipping it on to London. Unless our friend has some magical power of which I am not aware, I cannot see how this shipment can have concealed a secret.

Can it be that this is in any way helpful? It seems only to confirm what we both already knew: the crates were full of the curios shipped by Herr Kaiser for his stand at the exhibition. The bullets themselves are of little use, and, despite my suspicions, I cannot find anything in this account to suggest that the shipment was in any way unusual.

I look forward to our meeting on Thursday. I am hoping that, at the very least, you will be able to share the Janus Project file with me. If you feel able to share your deliberations on the shipment too, then I will consider the trip more than worthwhile.

Your intrigued friend,
Babbage

P.S. While I agree that the present cipher provides reasonable security, I do have an idea that may eventually lead to its demise. Wheatstone is experimenting with a new idea that may well lead to its replacement. Inspired by the ancients, I wonder if the Polybius cipher, in its various forms, might provide us with a useful alternative.

## Challenge 7A - "Palmerston is surprised and alarmed"
Column: `054231`

My Dear Babbage,

I must admit to some surprise at your request, but know from our history that I cannot afford to ignore it. Nonetheless, please take this advice:

The Prime Minister is deeply concerned that your actions may jeopardize our delicate negotiations with the Imperial Arms Manufacturing Company about supplying our troops. It is not yet public knowledge, but the innovation in this process lies in the simple replacement of tallow with mineral oils and grease in the design and manufacturing of the weapons.

The Company armies, which conquered and control much of the Indian subcontinent, are staffed with men of all faiths, and to many in that great land, the tallow on our current weapons is at best distasteful and at worst an intolerable insult to their religion.

The government benefits greatly from the fees paid by the Company to enhance its own Presidency Armies with regiments of our own. Between them, they need to arm over three hundred uniformed men, and a deal to arm them with Kaiser’s weapons will be of great mutual benefit.

The announcement of the deal is planned as a highlight of the World Fair, establishing our military and commercial supremacy and cementing our control of the region.

With that in mind, I urge you to tread carefully and to think carefully about how you use the information I have provided below.

You asked me to elaborate on the processes and procedures used by the Customs and Excise officials at the Port of Liverpool. I take it you have in mind the inspection of the Imperial Arms shipment, and so I arranged for a report from the agents themselves.

As with all shipments, they were examined before the shipping company were allowed to unpack them, guarded until that point by port officials supervised by the local customs officers. A sample of crates was summoned one at a time from the warehouse floor to the Excise office, where they were opened and unloaded, their contents checked against the manifest, and returned.

With only a few rifle crates to inspect, they were all checked, while, as you reported, only a select sample of the bullet crates were opened. These were identical, each containing two hundred boxes of bullets, which were themselves full.

The officials noted only that it was difficult to check the bullet boxes as they were randomly packed the right way up and upside down, meaning that they had to be removed and turned to allow them to be opened for inspection. The company manager was very apologetic and insisted on repacking the crates himself.

Apart from that, nothing unusual was noted in their report.

Having read your description of Miss Warne’s investigations and Mrs. Lovelace’s notes on the findings, I am afraid I cannot work out for myself why they are so concerned about this shipment, but I am sure that you will enlighten me at the appropriate time.

May I politely request that you only do so if, firstly, you are certain in your conclusions, and secondly, that your concerns merit the disruption that you are likely to cause to a significant strategic relationship.

With my very best,
Etc., Palmerston

## Challenge 7B - "Sometimes you need to look at something from a different angle to understand it ..."
Polybius: `ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXY`

My Dearest Charles,

I am so very grateful to you for writing to Lord Palmerston. I know that it must have been difficult for you to do so, given the delicacy of the matter, but I can assure you that it was certainly worth the risk. Everything we have learned confirmed my fears.

I think I can tell you now with complete certainty that we have not seen everything brought into the country in Herr Kaiser’s shipment. While it did not seem possible for the crates to contain anything in addition to the bullets, the report from the customs officials, together with Kate’s own findings, have revealed to me just how that could have been done.

I had thought that perhaps the smuggled cargo had been removed before the customs inspection, but I now believe that was not the case. The use of Roman numerals to label the crates seemed like a conceit relating to the names of the company and its proprietor, and echoing the use of the numerals on the bullets themselves. But I now believe that this was the intention:

The real reason for it was that certain of the numerals can be read upside down. The crates themselves were entirely symmetrical except for the numbers on them. But that meant that, by the artifice of inverting crates Nine and Eleven, they could be swapped without detection.

I am not sure whether the contraband was contained in crate Nine or Eleven, but whichever it was, if the officials summoned that crate, then the other was brought upside down, ready for inspection. In the unlikely event that both were requested, the safe crate would be furnished on both occasions.

The fact that the bullet boxes were randomly placed right way up and upside down in the crate meant that the trick would not be evident, and the contraband crate would never be inspected.

I was confused by the fact that when Kate inspected the crates, they were all full of bullet boxes, when throughout the journey, one of them had contained contraband. Where did the additional bullets come from? But that too is elementary, and I think you will enjoy discovering the ruse for yourself, so I will refrain from spoiling it for you.

We are left with the singular mystery of the smuggled goods. While I am certain in my own mind that something other than guns and bullets was shipped with the Kaiser armaments, I find myself at a loss to discern what that might have been.

Despite our very best efforts and Kate’s ingenuity, we have yet to find good evidence that Herr Kaiser was involved in any deception. I have spent many hours perusing the Janus Project files, with no clear insight into the nature of the encryption.

While I am sure that they contain the key to this mystery, I still have no insight into how we might best attack them. I am most eager to hear your own thoughts on this matter, and though I know you are busy, I would beg you, please, to meet with me at your very earliest convenience.

Yours,
Ada

## Challenge 8A - "Low down, dirty, two faced dog"
Vigenere with text reversed: `ORTHUS`

The most delicate aspect of control in the region is that the Company relies heavily upon troops recruited from among the indigenous population. These so-called sepoys are effective warriors, and their presence in the Presidency Armies both bolsters and weakens the East India Company.

On the one hand, it allows for a standing army much larger than could be provided by British soldiers alone. On the other hand, it risks internal division between the troops from the subcontinent and their officers, recruited from the British upper classes. There is also the constant worry of an armed uprising staffed by soldiers trained and armed by the EIC.

Much effort and money is expended on heading off that danger, and I see no reason why the Imperial Arms Company should not benefit from that largesse. It is well known that Hindu warriors are at best reluctant to pollute themselves with animal products extracted from the cow.

The common practice of lubricating ammunition with tallow has led to some unrest, and our introduction of mineral oils and greases in our weapons may go some way to alleviating their concerns.

I need hardly say that the contract to arm the East India Company regiments would be highly valuable.

All of this is pure speculation, and I think it would be wise for us to consult with the leaders of the Hindu and Sikh communities in order to establish whether our understanding of their concerns is correct, and if so, to what extent we have managed to address them.

Support from those quarters would provide the Board of the IAC with the assurance that it needs to make the required investments.

With this in mind, you are authorized to discreetly approach the courts of Duleep Singh and the Hindu Rajas to discern whether or not our plan would meet their approval.

Kaiser

## Challenge 8B - "Kate writes to Charles"
Modified Polybius: `RQPOMLKIHGFEDCBYXWVTSUNAJ`

My dear Charles,

I guess you have by now worked out the challenge set by Kaiser and solved already by our dear Mrs. Lovelace. I was kicking myself when I finally saw it, especially since I was the one who inspected the cargo in Liverpool. I should most probably have already figured the thing out for myself, but I must admit that I had to ask Mrs. Lovelace for some help, and her reply set me to thinking. If you have not yet resolved that mystery, perhaps her answer will help you too:

Given the bullet boxes were all askew in the crates when the customs officials inspected them, why were they all the right way up when I looked at them later? It is clear someone emptied the crates and then refilled them. But to what end? Was the contraband really that small that it could be hidden between the bullets? Was it hidden in the bullets themselves? I now know the answer to that riddle, but the question of what the contraband might be remains a deep mystery, and I am hoping that the files I inspected at Herr Kaiser’s mansion may reveal the secret to us.

Mrs. Lovelace has, with her usual grace and kindness, been teaching me the art of decipherment, and together we have been working on the Janus Project files with but little success, though the page I have included in this letter does show some promise. Mrs. Lovelace has determined that this one is most likely enciphered using a Vigenère cipher, but our attempts to solve it have not been successful, and I fear we must have missed something. Perhaps you will be more successful.

Well, I hope you have managed to receive and to decode this letter and that you find it helpful. I understand that Wheatstone has now completed the installation and testing of his telegraphic apparatus at all our homes, and so we are expecting your reply by way of that machine. It will be most exciting to see it in operation.

With my fond regards,
Kate Warne

## 9A - "The Rule of Three"
Vigenere: `TRIPLECROSSDEVIL`

The worst outcome for the maintenance of peace in the Indian subcontinent would, without doubt, arise from a three-way conflict between the Hindu, Sikh, and British parties.

Tension between them is already high, with the Maharaja resenting deeply the theft of the Koh-i-Noor diamond. The humiliation entailed in being forced to part with it has left a deep scar, and any further provocation could well lead to open conflict. The proposal to recut the gem is just such an insult.

If, in this tense atmosphere, anything were to happen to the diamond, then war might well ensue. Indeed, were the Hindu community to be implicated in any way, then this conflict would be likely to spread.

The only winners in such a situation would be those in a place to profit from the violence. Short of direct intervention, it seems highly unlikely that such a precious gem could be allowed to suffer any harm. However, given the nature of the display of the gem at the exhibition, it would be very hard for anyone to be sure of its safety.

And if, say, there was any evidence of a plot by the Rajas to steal the diamond, then the other two parties would be likely to react forcefully.

Babbage and Palmerston seem remarkably sanguine about the security of the diamond, but I suspect that this is merely a display of the famously phlegmatic British spirit. They undoubtedly have in place a number of measures intended to protect it, but even they cannot have foreseen every eventuality.

If the diamond were to be left alone for any length of time, then it would be highly vulnerable to theft. It is safe, I think, to assume that the guards are under strict instructions not to leave it alone, but it is not difficult to imagine situations in which they would be forced to do so, nor ways which an agile mind could find to engineer such a situation.

Kaiser

## 9B - "Number Theory"

My Dearest Charles and Lord Palmerston,

I understand that you are both still at a loss concerning the method used to smuggle contraband into our country. I had thought it rather obvious given the information furnished by your own dear Kate. However, time is passing, and I must explain the ruse so that we may move on to more pressing issues.

The bullets were shipped in boxes packed edge to edge in the crates, with one crate emptied of all but two hundred flattened boxes. These would be needed later. The remaining capacity in the crate was used for the smuggled goods. But what of those bullets?

The boxes in the other crates each contained twenty-three, packed tight. I will send you a sketch of the arrangement this afternoon, which makes it apparent that the boxes could easily accept this number. When Kate inspected the boxes, she found that each contained only twenty-two bullets.

Once the customs officials had released the shipments, someone removed the contraband and redistributed the ammunition. One bullet was taken from each box, and together they were packed into the now-empty crate. Twenty-two bullets in each of four thousand six hundred boxes gives the same number as twenty-three in each of four thousand four hundred, and so the deception was complete.

I would perhaps have missed this if it were not for the comment about the random orientation of the bullets when inspected by the revenue officers. This was so at odds with the ordered sketch provided for us by Kate that it was apparent that someone had taken the trouble to empty all the boxes and to repack them.

Unfortunately for them, and fortunately for us, their penchant for order signaled what they had done. None of this helps us to determine the original contents of the other crate, though I have my suspicions, which have been prompted by the second Janus Project file. I leave it to you both to consider its contents to see if you are drawn to the same alarming conclusion as I am.

With my fondest regards,
Ada Lovelace

P.S. I realise now that I should have taken care to encypher this message before encoding it on the new telegraphy system. However, given the urgency of this message and since we are the only parties to the upgraded machines, I have decided to risk sending it without further effort. In the unlikely event that Kaiser or his co-conspirators intercept our communications and decode them, then at worst they will surely realise that the game is up, bringing an end to their plans.

If my suspicions are correct, that would be a victory of sorts. Preventing the forthcoming disaster is surely more important than establishing proof that Herr Kaiser is behind it.

## 10A - "The best laid plans..."

JANUS PROJECT FILES, PART THREE: THE DETONATORS

Enclosed in the shipment are of our own design, and each can produce a shockwave equivalent to that of a small rifle cartridge. Accordingly, they take up a similar space, though the absence of any projectile means that more can fit into the crate.

The deployment of these devices should be relatively routine. Being small and unobtrusive, they are extremely unlikely to be discovered under casual inspection, especially since we have been able to colour their cases using the exact paint specified for the India Pavilion steelwork. This is due, of course, to the influence of our patron, Herr Kaiser, to whom we owe our deepest thanks.

The charges are too small to cause much damage to the steelwork itself, but since it is not our intention to destroy the pavilion, but only to clear it, this is not a significant issue. A suitably coordinated discharge should achieve our aims, and the ingenious new timing mechanisms—employing the marvellous miniaturised clock mechanisms developed by the company—will ensure maximum impact.

## 10B - "The report"

MY DEAR LORD PALMERSTON,

It is with relief that I am able to report that our efforts to thwart Kaiser’s plot have been successful. Following the successful decipherment of the final page in the Janus Project files, the detonators were discovered and retrieved without incident.

I must admit that when the Countess and Miss Warne first outlined the plot to me, I was skeptical. My skepticism was fully shared by Wheatstone, who, as an experienced engineer, remarked that the quantity of explosives contained within a single crate would have only the slightest effect on the integrity of the steel frame housing the pavilion. As you may imagine, the ladies pressed their point, and Wheatstone turned a peculiar colour when they explained that, under the cumulative effect of thousands of charges, the steel might survive, but the glass canopy most certainly would not. The vibrations across the structure would have set up shockwaves that would, in turn, have led to a rain of glass shards upon the crowds beneath. I shudder to think of the casualties.

It now seems clear that the terror following such an explosion was intended to lead to chaos in the hall. It would have been easy for conspirators to steal away the Koh-i-Noor diamond in the guise of bystanders rushing to aid the wounded. Things would have been dramatically worse had our Queen or her family been in attendance at the time of the explosions. She has already indicated that she will visit the exhibition regularly throughout the season, and even the urging of King Ernest has failed to dissuade her. His letter outlining the threat seemed persuasive to me, almost prescient in his assertion that I am astonished the ministers themselves do not insist on her at least going to Osbourne during the exhibition, as no human being can possibly answer for what may occur on the occasion.

Nonetheless, we feel that this was not the intention of the plotters. The assassination of our treasured monarch would have enraged her subjects and provoked a deep and wide investigation, increasing the risk to the conspirators. In any case, the little proof we do have of Kaiser’s intentions suggests a more mercantile approach. The efforts to implicate the Hindu community in the theft would undoubtedly have resulted in much unrest in India. The loss of the diamond would have also infuriated the Maharajah, increasing the likelihood of an uprising that would have been, at best, difficult to manage. Herr Kaiser stood to gain significantly from any ensuing drawn-out conflict, as he equipped all sides. A war would have been more vicious but, in all likelihood, much shorter, and he stood to gain far less from it.

It is only because of the tenacity and curiosity of Kate Warne that this plot was ever uncovered, and we owe her an enormous debt. The Countess has done her very best to persuade Miss Warne to remain here and to continue working with us, but I am afraid that even she could not prevent our American friend from returning to the places she knows best. We are very reluctant to see her leave; however, I understand that our friend Mr. Allan Pinkerton is setting up an agency that may have use for her particular skills. I wonder if we should perhaps write to him.

As for Kaiser, we have wrestled mightily to determine what would be best. The evidence against him as an individual is, at best, circumstantial. No court would allow us to adduce documents reproduced only from Kate’s recollection, and it is highly unlikely that we will be able to obtain the originals now. We are left, therefore, with the unpleasant conclusion that he and his co-conspirators are likely to escape punishment. He will not, however, avoid the consequences of his treachery. You have already agreed to cancel the contract of supply with his firm, and I believe that the India Company has agreed to follow your lead. Kaiser may be free to sell his weapons in his own country, but we will continue to use more traditional rifles and ammunition, unsullied with the mineral oils and greases of which he is so proud. Tallow has provided a suitable lubricant for us until now, and Wheatstone assures us that there is no good reason to change that.

With our best wishes to you and the government, and our loyal best wishes to Her Majesty,
Your humble servants,
Charles Babbage, Ada Lovelace, Kate Warne, Charles Wheatstone
