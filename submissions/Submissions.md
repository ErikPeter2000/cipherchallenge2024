## Challenge 0A
Ada Lovelace and Charles Babbage are two of the most important members of our community.
They featured in the first National Cipher Challenge, and again some years later when we explored their early meeting. In this adventure, we are returning to the end of her life, at least the part recorded in the archives at BOSS headquarters.

I found this story by accident when I was researching the role of the royal family in our national security. Many of them served in the military and are familiar with codes and ciphers, and I wondered how far back that interest went. That was how I stumbled across a note from Prince Albert to Lord Palmerston, and that started me down the rabbit hole that led us here.

I hope you enjoy it as much as I did. We will meet some fascinating new characters on the way, and the story takes a twist or two. Of course, I know how it ends — you don't yet, but if you stick with it, you will. And like me, you will probably learn something on the way.

I have posted a sketch of a bullet that was sent to Ada back in — on the case files page. That was where the story began and what drew Ada in. Take a look and see if you can figure out what it might have meant. It is not a bad place to start.

## Challenge 0B
My dear Palmerston,

I was reluctant to believe that the mystery of the silver bullet could defeat the brilliant minds in your office, but I have come to the conclusion that the singular Miss Warne was correct in her assumption that this particular cipher would defeat us. Her choice of the Countess as her confidante and collaborator was inspired.

The markings on the bullet were clearly significant, though their meaning escaped me entirely until explained. With that knowledge, the accompanying letter commands our attention with its dark allusions to the end of the Empire.

I know that you are tempted to ask the two fearsome ladies to step aside and allow the experts in your department to take on the investigation, but my own experience of my dear wife suggests that once roused, the tigress is unlikely to abandon its meal. And I fear that we will have to stand aside and allow them to continue on their adventure.

It is clear that they have the skills and determination to see this through, and I think we will only obstruct them if we interfere. I trust that you have reached the same conclusion and that I can ask Babbage to convey your thanks and best wishes to them both, in the hope that they can bring a speedy resolution to this troubling matter.

Yours,
Albert

## Challenge 1A - "Curio(u)s"
Mr. Charles Babbage
Dorset Street, Marylebone, London

My dear Charles,

I hope this letter finds you well, and that your campaign to consign the infernal racket of street urchins and their music to the outer reaches of the city has borne some fruit. I am writing to tell you about a curious letter that I received this morning from a woman in America. I took note as she had taken the time to encrypt its contents and had included a puzzle consisting of a short sequence of letters engraved on a bullet.

The circumstances in which this bullet appeared are not fully explained, but her request is that we should consider the engraving and attempt to decipher its meaning. I say "we" and "our," but I must admit that the request was directed to me alone, possibly because, as a woman, I might pay more attention to Miss Warne's letter. It is apparent from the scrawl on the page that she is not highly educated, but she describes herself as a detective and had the wit to recognize that the inscription was significant.

I think I have unlocked its secret, but I would be pleased to hear your thoughts. In particular, is she right in her assumption that the letters signify something to which we should attend? It seems more likely to me that it is merely a curio.

I have missed our discussions, and if I flatter myself that you enjoyed them too, I hope that this curious bullet might give us the excuse that we need to reinstate them. Please do let me know your thoughts.

Yours, as always,
Ada, Countess of Lovelace

## Challenge 1B - "The Cypher(s)"

Horsley Towers, East Horsley, Surrey, England

My dear Mrs. Lovelace,

I was unsure how to address you, so I hope that this letter finds you, and finds you well. I am writing because I do not know who else to turn to, and I figure that you might be able to help. I am sorry for the trouble I may have caused by ciphering this letter, but I was not sure that you would read a message sent in my hand. Not knowing nothing about me, it seemed more likely you would make the effort if the message was harder to read.

If not, and I am wrong about your interests in codes and ciphers, then perhaps it won’t matter whether you read it or not.

I am a detective in the small town of Erin, New York, and in a recent investigation, I came upon a strangeness that I cannot unpick. I was asked to investigate a break-in at a local warehouse. The hasp had been removed and clumsily replaced, alerting the owner, but nothing seemed to be missing, and the shipping crates remained sealed. Behind them, I found a bullet carrying an unusual inscription, and have included a sketch. It is mighty unusual for a case to be marked in this way, and the letters make no sense to me. I am hoping that you will be able to help interpret them. With luck, that might shed some light on my investigation. Given the bullet was found with a shipment bound for England, there may also be reason for you to be worried, but I most sincerely hope not.

If you have read this far, then please understand how much I appreciate your assistance. I look forward with some eagerness to your reply.

With my gratitude,
Miss Kate Warne
