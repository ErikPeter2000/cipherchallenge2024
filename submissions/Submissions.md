## Challenge 0A
Ada Lovelace and Charles Babbage are two of the most important members of our community.
They featured in the first National Cipher Challenge, and again some years later when we explored their early meeting. In this adventure, we are returning to the end of her life, at least the part recorded in the archives at BOSS headquarters.

I found this story by accident when I was researching the role of the royal family in our national security. Many of them served in the military and are familiar with codes and ciphers, and I wondered how far back that interest went. That was how I stumbled across a note from Prince Albert to Lord Palmerston, and that started me down the rabbit hole that led us here.

I hope you enjoy it as much as I did. We will meet some fascinating new characters on the way, and the story takes a twist or two. Of course, I know how it ends — you don't yet, but if you stick with it, you will. And like me, you will probably learn something on the way.

I have posted a sketch of a bullet that was sent to Ada back in — on the case files page. That was where the story began and what drew Ada in. Take a look and see if you can figure out what it might have meant. It is not a bad place to start.

## Challenge 0B
My dear Palmerston,

I was reluctant to believe that the mystery of the silver bullet could defeat the brilliant minds in your office, but I have come to the conclusion that the singular Miss Warne was correct in her assumption that this particular cipher would defeat us. Her choice of the Countess as her confidante and collaborator was inspired.

The markings on the bullet were clearly significant, though their meaning escaped me entirely until explained. With that knowledge, the accompanying letter commands our attention with its dark allusions to the end of the Empire.

I know that you are tempted to ask the two fearsome ladies to step aside and allow the experts in your department to take on the investigation, but my own experience of my dear wife suggests that once roused, the tigress is unlikely to abandon its meal. And I fear that we will have to stand aside and allow them to continue on their adventure.

It is clear that they have the skills and determination to see this through, and I think we will only obstruct them if we interfere. I trust that you have reached the same conclusion and that I can ask Babbage to convey your thanks and best wishes to them both, in the hope that they can bring a speedy resolution to this troubling matter.

Yours,
Albert

## Challenge 1A - "Curio(u)s"
Mr. Charles Babbage
Dorset Street, Marylebone, London

My dear Charles,

I hope this letter finds you well, and that your campaign to consign the infernal racket of street urchins and their music to the outer reaches of the city has borne some fruit. I am writing to tell you about a curious letter that I received this morning from a woman in America. I took note as she had taken the time to encrypt its contents and had included a puzzle consisting of a short sequence of letters engraved on a bullet.

The circumstances in which this bullet appeared are not fully explained, but her request is that we should consider the engraving and attempt to decipher its meaning. I say "we" and "our," but I must admit that the request was directed to me alone, possibly because, as a woman, I might pay more attention to Miss Warne's letter. It is apparent from the scrawl on the page that she is not highly educated, but she describes herself as a detective and had the wit to recognize that the inscription was significant.

I think I have unlocked its secret, but I would be pleased to hear your thoughts. In particular, is she right in her assumption that the letters signify something to which we should attend? It seems more likely to me that it is merely a curio.

I have missed our discussions, and if I flatter myself that you enjoyed them too, I hope that this curious bullet might give us the excuse that we need to reinstate them. Please do let me know your thoughts.

Yours, as always,
Ada, Countess of Lovelace

## Challenge 1B - "The Cypher(s)"

Horsley Towers, East Horsley, Surrey, England

My dear Mrs. Lovelace,

I was unsure how to address you, so I hope that this letter finds you, and finds you well. I am writing because I do not know who else to turn to, and I figure that you might be able to help. I am sorry for the trouble I may have caused by ciphering this letter, but I was not sure that you would read a message sent in my hand. Not knowing nothing about me, it seemed more likely you would make the effort if the message was harder to read.

If not, and I am wrong about your interests in codes and ciphers, then perhaps it won’t matter whether you read it or not.

I am a detective in the small town of Erin, New York, and in a recent investigation, I came upon a strangeness that I cannot unpick. I was asked to investigate a break-in at a local warehouse. The hasp had been removed and clumsily replaced, alerting the owner, but nothing seemed to be missing, and the shipping crates remained sealed. Behind them, I found a bullet carrying an unusual inscription, and have included a sketch. It is mighty unusual for a case to be marked in this way, and the letters make no sense to me. I am hoping that you will be able to help interpret them. With luck, that might shed some light on my investigation. Given the bullet was found with a shipment bound for England, there may also be reason for you to be worried, but I most sincerely hope not.

If you have read this far, then please understand how much I appreciate your assistance. I look forward with some eagerness to your reply.

With my gratitude,
Miss Kate Warne

## Challenge 2A - "A letter addressed to Ada"

Mrs. Ada Lovelace  
Horsley Towers  
East Horsley  
Surrey  

My dearest Ada,

I was very pleased to receive your letter, and I must apologise that I have taken so long to reply. My duties with regards to the Great Exhibition are absorbing most of my waking hours, leaving little time for other pursuits.

The news that the great Koh-i-Noor diamond is to play a central role in the exhibition has caused considerable consternation among the organisers. The need for security is in some conflict with Her Majesty’s expressed hope that her subjects will be suitably enchanted by the jewel. It is not that impressive, even at close hand, having been cut in the Indian style rather than the faceted cut with which we are more familiar in the West. While large, its failure to catch the light leaves it rather underwhelming, especially placed within a secure enclosure at some distance from the spectators. All the solutions proposed to date have failed to meet royal approval, but I will be discussing the India Pavilion with Prince Albert later today, and I hope that we might settle on a satisfactory solution then. That would free me to spend more time on other interests.

Which brings me to that other rough diamond, Miss Warne. Her letter to you has rather caught my attention. I had not heard that our American cousins had adopted the custom of employing female detectives, and my contacts at Scotland Yard were equally surprised. After a little reflection, I realised that we had no right to be. You have already demonstrated that women have much to offer in fields once reserved to men, and Miss Warne’s letter shows that your example is known across the world. I suspect that we will find many others of your sex following in your footsteps. I look forward to meeting some of them, though perhaps not Miss Warne, who I suspect could not afford the cost of a transatlantic crossing.

To the matter in hand: I am not sure what the markings on the bullet case might mean. It is an unusual set of letters — too long for an acronym, and not a word in any language with which I am familiar. On the other hand, the triple "F" and lack of vowels make it highly unlikely to be an English word encrypted with a substitution or permutation cypher, or even with a combination of these. Context is everything, and it would be very helpful if Miss Warne could provide some. I have no sense of how urgent her enquiry might be, and even the fastest ships take over a week to carry the post, so I think that we should respond quickly. We need to know if there are any other clues that might help us to determine the meaning of the inscription.

Will you be in the city this week? Perhaps we could meet to discuss the wording of our letter.

With my fondest wishes for you and your husband,  
Charles Babbage

## Challenge 2B - "Don't forget the stamp"

Dear Miss Warne,

Thank you for your letter and the intriguing puzzle that you sent me. I have discussed it with my close friend and collaborator, Mr. Charles Babbage, and we are both of the opinion that it is a mystery that demands a little more context if we are to be of any assistance to you. We hope that we are able to help you, but we are somewhat uncertain whether this is something that demands our immediate attention. If so, how do you propose that we should proceed? Even with the improvements in transatlantic traffic, it will take some time to investigate this matter by post, and I am afraid we are still some way from the introduction of the transatlantic telegraph. (Though our friend Mr. Wheatstone is working all hours to hasten that development.) We would be grateful if you could reply with any further information that may help us.

On the matter of the bullet, Mr. Babbage has suggested the possibility that the lettering might be of foreign origin, but we are not aware of a language in which this combination of Latin consonants could signify an expressible word. He suggested also that the characters might be those of an acronym, though the lack of punctuation and the relatively large number of letters makes this, too, unlikely.

We are then brought to the possibility, which I am sure you had in mind, that the text on the case might represent some form of encyphered communication. The shortness of the text presents a significant problem. We are unable to apply our usual techniques of frequency analysis to determine any pattern, and without more context we have no cribs or other clues to its likely meaning. In your letter, you mentioned that the bullet was found in a shipping warehouse near a stack of sealed crates, and that these were bound for England. We would find it most helpful if you could tell us, should you know, the contents of those crates, the individual or corporation to which they belong, and the recipient for whom they are or were intended.

I am sorry it has taken so long for me to reply to you, but Mr. Babbage is heavily involved in the preparations for the international fair to be held later in the year. Given the Prince Consort’s involvement, you can imagine that there are high expectations on all of those who are involved in its delivery. Be assured, however, that we will give our full attention to your reply, and we hope to be able to assist you.

With our very best wishes,  
Ada Lovelace and Charles Babbage

## Challenge 3A - "Roman-a clef?"

My dear Charles,

I hope this letter finds you well rested, for I have the most surprising news. Expecting a reply from Miss Warne, I have been waiting eagerly for the post, in the hope that she would be able to shed more light on the mystery of the silver bullet. What I did not expect, when the doorbell rang, was that Miss Warne herself would be ushered into my morning room! She was somewhat disheveled and close to starving, as if she had walked here, and it took some time for her to recover enough to tell me what she was doing in England.

It appears that she took to heart our concern that this matter would be delayed by the continual exchange of letters, and, discovering that the shipping crates were to be transported to England on the *Pacific*, she made arrangements to travel with the cargo. What arrangements those might have been, she has been too coy to explain. For the moment, I have lodged her with my maid in the attic here at the Towers. The staff have been marvelous, providing her with suitable clothes, and sharing meals. I am not sure how Miss Warne will manage in the longer term, but for now, she is settled, and I think we should concentrate our attention on the information that she has brought with her.

Given that there is a sensitivity to this matter, I would prefer to tell you about it in person. In any case, you may well wish to hear the story from Miss Warne herself, so I propose that we meet here at Horsley at your earliest convenience. In a curious coincidence of timing, Sir Charles is also planning to visit shortly to discuss installing his telegraphic system at our residences in order to speed communication. Perhaps we can arrange matters so that he too can be briefed on the issues in this case.

Speaking of briefing, I think it would be appropriate to keep Lord Palmerston informed of our investigations. Without saying too much at this stage, there are diplomatic issues at play, and he might prefer to lead on these matters. Could I ask you to write to him? You know how he hates to be bothered by women. It might be a good idea to encipher all our communications with his office using our customary transposition cipher. I do not entirely trust the discretion of those in his private office.

With my fondest regards,  
Ada

## Challenge 3B - "A rough diamond"

My dear Palmerston,

I believe that Prince Albert may already have written to you concerning this matter, and I am a little embarrassed to write this letter at all, but I hope you will understand. I find myself at the mercy of two strong-willed women who assure me that this matter is urgent. You have already been informed about our unexpected guest, Miss Warne, who arrived last week to our astonishment on the steamship Pacific. She is a little coy about how she afforded the journey, and I suspect that she might have been a stowaway. While I am inclined to deal strongly with that matter, the Countess has expressed the equally strong view that we should first address the reasons for Miss Warne’s visit. Given the sensitivity of the matters described below, I think she is probably right.

Miss Warne has determined that the mysterious bullet was manufactured by the Imperial Arms Company, which, as you know, is owned by Julius Kaiser, sponsor of the India Pavilion. The bullet was designed as a novelty item to be distributed at the Exhibition, with the engraved letters denoting the date of the Exhibition opening. The date was encrypted, the cipher in this case being a rather simple Caesar shift. I suppose Kaiser felt that this was rather clever, though it seems an obscure way to market his company. That, perhaps, is a mark of the man's character—he fancies himself the cleverest man in every room. But he is funding the Pavilion, and it is important that we do nothing to offend him.

That discovery might have closed the matter, and I was inclined to ship the somewhat overenthusiastic Miss Warne back to her home in New York. However, the Countess has persuaded me that my initial impressions were prejudicial, and there does seem to be something more to this affair. Miss Warne found the bullet next to a stack of sealed crates marked with the logo of the manufacturer. They had been shipped there from Chicago. The crates contained rifles and ammunition developed by the company for the climate in the subcontinent. The company is hopeful that the British government and the EIC would both be interested in purchasing them. That does explain Herr Kaiser’s interest in the Exhibition. It will act as a marketplace for his new weapons, but also an opportunity to curry favor with the Prince, given his influence with the government. That might improve his chance of winning a contract.

Miss Warne swears that the crates had not been tampered with. The company seals were intact, witnessed by the photographs brought by Miss Warne, and it is not clear how or why one of the bullets should have escaped them. It seems possible that either a rival manufacturer or a criminal gang may have stolen the contents of one or more of the crates, somehow managing to reseal them but leaving this one small clue to their activities. In this, we may have been lucky. If the shipment had appeared to be deficient on arrival at the Exhibition, it would have been difficult to establish that the theft had occurred in the U.S. We might then have been accused of carelessness in our handling of the consignment.

I think it would be in our best interests to examine the company's crates before they leave the ship, which arrived in Liverpool earlier this week. Fortunately, the current dockworkers' strike has delayed unloading, so we should have time to commission a full check of the cargo before it lands. If anything is amiss, then we will be able to assure Mr. Kaiser that the issue arose before the crates reached us.

I am aware of the sensitivities in this matter. With the display of the Koh-i-Noor at its heart, the India Pavilion is very dear to both the Prince and Her Majesty the Queen. It would be most embarrassing if its principal sponsor, Herr Kaiser, should feel that we are not affording him every assistance in his own endeavors.

With my very best wishes,
Babbage

## Challenge 4A - "Imperious"

Mr. Charles Babbage
Dorset Street, Marylebone
London

My dearest Charles,

Our dinner with Herr Kaiser and his entourage was a success measured in terms of diplomacy, though less so in terms of intelligence. Our guest spoke at length about his ambition to serve Her Majesty, and his interest in the subcontinent was more than evident. It is clear that he is a man of singular will, and his desire to establish Imperial Arms as, in his words, “a truly global company” was asserted more than once. He is a man of many interests, and in that, he reminded me of Wheatstone—though unlike our taciturn friend, Herr Kaiser is rather keen to ensure that everyone knows it. I suspect that whatever our topic had been, he would have made sure to be the principal interlocutor.

I mean no offense, but it is hard in any company for a woman’s voice to be heard, and in his company, I suspect that it is impossible. Fortunately, my dear husband William was able to play his part, and with surprising subtlety, was able to press our questions about the Imperial shipment. William did his very best to interrogate Herr Kaiser along the lines you suggested, with questions concerning the barrel, the firing mechanism, and the cartridge design, and the answers seemed assured and persuasive to all who listened. Yet here, just a few hours later, we find ourselves unable to recall a single innovation in the design.

Herr Kaiser’s enthusiasm cannot be doubted. His commitment to the Exhibition is paralleled only by that of the dear Prince, and I worry that our government might be seduced by his charm and intensity of will. Should they really be considering a transatlantic partnership at the cost of our own manufacturers? That does not seem to me to be in the spirit of the Great Exhibition.

On the issue of security of the shipment, William trod very carefully. He was careful not to indicate any concern on our part, but managed to enquire discreetly about the company’s own arrangements. Herr Kaiser was open in his praise for the port’s authority, but spoke at length, as you might expect, about the superior quality of American security arrangements, hinting that the cargo had been secure throughout its journey. I think we can take it that he was not aware of Kate’s investigations.

Which brings me to my final point. I awoke this morning to find a letter addressed to us both from Miss Warne. She has departed for Liverpool with the intention of examining the Imperial Arms cargo for herself, though I am unsure what she expects to find. Let us hope that she returns with something useful to our deliberations.

With my fondest regards,
Ada

## Challenge 4B - "Counting for the Countess"

For the Attention of Mrs. Ada Lovelace and Mr. Charles Babbage
Horsley Towers, East Horsley
Surrey, England

My dear Countess and Mr. Babbage,

I have completed my investigations at the Imperial Arms customs warehouse and will return forthwith. But knowing just how long that journey may take, and how remarkably swift your Royal Mail can be, I thought it best to send you my report by letter.

My new friends in Liverpool were real helpful and provided me with the shipping papers, although I am not sure how much assistance they will provide. All I can see is that the crates all left the United States together, and each weighed the same, suggesting that nothing had been taken. I find it mighty unlikely that anyone interested in stealing the contents of a single crate would take the trouble to replace them with a carefully calibrated weight of rubble or other nonsense. And in any case, the seal had been replaced—that seems like an awful lot of trouble for a few rifles and boxes of ammunition.

With the crates in storage, the seals have been removed, presumably to allow your customs officials to inspect them, and that gave me an opportunity to examine the contents. It took me a long time to work through them all, but it’s the darnedest thing: there is nothing missing, and I mean nothing—not even a single bullet. And we know that at least one was left on the floor of the warehouse in Erin.

My friends tell me that a Hindu gentleman had been seen in the vicinity of the shed the past night, but I am minded to think that is just scuttlebutt. Folks in Erin talk like that about strangers all the time, and with nothing to connect him to the cargo and no way to track him down, I think we can ignore, if not forget, the gossip.

I hope to be with you again in three days and look forward to discussing this mystery with you then.

Miss Kate Warne

## Challenge 5A - "Stranger, danger?"

My Dear Charles,

Kate has returned covered in grease and dirt and barely able to talk after her journey. Once she had recovered, and my maid had found her a change of clothing, we discussed her discoveries at length. She is a most thoughtful young woman, and her rough speech and manners disguise a keen eye and a sharp intellect.

She provided me with the following details concerning Herr Kaiser’s arms shipment:

Crate Types:
The shipment is comprised of two styles of crate:

Long and narrow crates, each containing six rifles manufactured by the Imperial Arms Company. The guns are packed in straw and protected with a mineral oil rust inhibitor. Kate noted that she is more used to seeing guns shipped in tallow and, I think in jest, remarked that this was the only new element in the manufacture of the guns. I do not recall this being mentioned by Herr Kaiser, but then it is such a trivial point.
Tea chest-style crates, each containing two hundred boxes of cartridges.
Cartridge Details:
Kate sketched the contents for me, but there is nothing remarkable about them except the quantity. I will show you the sketches when you visit, as they are too large to enclose.

Seals and Inspection:
The seals of several crates had been removed for inspection by the customs officials, and others had been subsequently removed by the warehouse staff at the request of the company. This allowed Kate to inspect all of them. She spent a night removing all the contents and checking them. Each crate contained the same number of boxes, and each box contained the same number of cartridges, protected with a mineral grease (again, in preference to tallow). Each box was full, as was each crate, so I think we can be sure that nothing had been tampered with.

You can reassure Palmerston that there is no reason for concern about the security of the shipment. I understand that it is already on its way to the exhibition, accompanied by staff from Imperial Arms.

The Gentleman in the Vicinity:
I did ask Kate about the gentleman who had been spied in the vicinity of the warehouse, but she had little to add apart from the fact that he wore a peculiar gem in his turban. I believe these are known as sarpechs, and we can take it from this description that he was, in fact, a Sikh, not a Hindu. A peculiarity lay in the fact that the gems adorning it were all black. I do not think she had appreciated the full significance. These decorations are only worn by those of royal descent.
I would think it a mere curiosity were it not for the fact that the Great Diamond will play such a significant role in the exhibition. I know that not all of the Sikhs were in favour of Maharajah Duleep Singh’s magnificent gift to Her Majesty, and while I cannot at present make a connection between the Koh-i-Noor and Herr Kaiser, it must at least be possible that there is one.

May I request that you consult with Palmerston on this matter? Are any of his staff familiar with the gentleman spied in Liverpool? And are the security services confident that the diamond will be safe?

With so many questions arising from Kate’s report, I feel that we ought to take a little more care in our communications from this time on. May I take the liberty of suggesting that your reply should be secured with a Vigenère cipher using my personal key?

I look forward to your reply, as always.

Ada

## Challenge 5B - "Troublemaker"

My Dear Ada,

I am sorry for the delay in my reply. I have found the last few days remarkably busy. Before I could respond to your letter, I was called to Whitehall Place to deal with an incident that had occurred at Kaiser’s lodgings.

A young woman had been apprehended outside the property carrying a large bag in which were found photographic equipment and plates. Not believing her story of being a journalist and recognizing her accent as American, the constable placed her under arrest. Fortunately, recognizing the potential for a diplomatic incident, he transported the suspect to headquarters, whereupon she requested that I should be called.

I am still unclear what prompted Miss Warne in her actions, but she clearly believes that Herr Kaiser has something to hide and apparently took it upon herself to break into his lodge and to take photographs of documents she found there. She apparently borrowed the equipment from Wheatstone, who has been experimenting with faster exposure imaging. What he thought he was doing in assisting the young lady, I am at a loss to explain. Miss Warne seems to possess a charm that is lost on me but which persuades others to join her in her mad adventures.

The delay has been caused in part by the need to process the plates and to consider their contents. Unfortunately, our amateur photographer failed to protect the images, and they were badly overexposed. I suspect she had not realized just how sensitive Wheatstone’s formula is. The only legible part of any of the images was the phrase "Janus Project." According to Miss Warne, this was written on the cover of a file containing encrypted documents, which she had also attempted to copy.

It has taken all my persuasion, and an intervention by Palmerston, to get her released, and I am afraid that the police have confiscated all of the equipment. I foresee a disagreeable conversation with Wheatstone in my near future.

I do not know what we are to make of this. Palmerston has made it clear that Miss Warne cannot be allowed to continue in this irresponsible way. She risks jeopardizing the delicate negotiations between the government and Herr Kaiser’s company. And yet, I think she may be onto something.

I asked Palmerston about the Sikh with the black sarpech, and he immediately knew who I meant. The gentleman in question is a prince and high-ranking official in Duleep Singh’s entourage. He is visiting the Great Exhibition as the official representative of the Maharajah and has been heavily involved in discussions about the display of the diamond. The Maharajah is deeply concerned that the gem should be fully appreciated by Her Majesty’s subjects but shares her concern at our ability to ensure its safety.

Not wishing to stir up more ill feeling over the gift of the diamond, those discussions have been at the highest level, and I was not made aware of them until now. Palmerston was also not aware that the prince had left London, but he was not unduly surprised nor was he alarmed that there might be a connection between the Maharajah and Herr Kaiser, given that the latter is sponsoring the India Pavilion.

While I agree that we need to continue our investigations, can I ask you please to do your very best to tame Miss Warne? The little time I have available is better spent contemplating her discoveries than dealing with the authorities on her behalf.

With my best wishes, as always, to you and your husband,
Babbage
