My dear Mrs. Lovelace,

I was unsure how to address you, so I hope that this letter finds you, and finds you well. I am writing because I do not know who else to turn to, and I figure that you might be able to help. I am sorry for the trouble I may have caused by ciphering this letter, but I was not sure that you would read a message sent in my hand. Not knowing nothing about me, it seemed more likely you would make the effort if the message was harder to read.

If not, and I am wrong about your interests in codes and ciphers, then perhaps it wonâ€™t matter whether you read it or not.

I am a detective in the small town of Erin, New York, and in a recent investigation, I came upon a strangeness that I cannot unpick. I was asked to investigate a break-in at a local warehouse. The hasp had been removed and clumsily replaced, alerting the owner, but nothing seemed to be missing, and the shipping crates remained sealed. Behind them, I found a bullet carrying an unusual inscription, and have included a sketch. It is mighty unusual for a case to be marked in this way, and the letters make no sense to me. I am hoping that you will be able to help interpret them. With luck, that might shed some light on my investigation. Given the bullet was found with a shipment bound for England, there may also be reason for you to be worried, but I most sincerely hope not.

If you have read this far, then please understand how much I appreciate your assistance. I look forward with some eagerness to your reply.

With my gratitude,
Miss Kate Warne</cleanedData>
