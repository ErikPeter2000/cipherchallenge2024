## Organisation
Instead of meeting in person, we used Discord to voice call each Thursday night to work on the ciphers together. For source control and organisation of code and submissions, we used GitHub. Our repository is organised into different sections for the code, testing and submissions for each challenge. We also made use of GitHub Issues to manage and allocate tasks to be done. 

## Software used
Even before the challenge began, we made a list of possible ciphers and started developing software to crack each one. Instead of relying on guessing or knowing the keys for each cipher, we decided to develop brute force algorithms using hill-climbing methods and focusing mainly on the efficiency of these solutions. To ensure accuracy within these algorithms, we did unit testing using data from [dCode? Not sure.]. These main algorithms were written in Scala although for the most part each team member used the language they were most familliar with for each challenge (Java, JavaScript).
