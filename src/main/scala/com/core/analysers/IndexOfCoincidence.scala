/** Calculates the Index of Coincidence (IoC) of a given data block. IoC is a measure of how likely it is that two
  * randomly selected letters from a text are the same. The formula is:
  *
  * `IoC = Î£(frequency of each letter * (frequency of each letter - 1)) / (n * (n - 1))`
  *
  * Where `n` is the length of the data block.
  *
  * For pure alphabetic English text, the IoC is between 0.065 and 0.07. For random text, the IoC is 0.0385 (1/26).
  *
  * Sometimes, the IoC is normalised by multiplying it by the size of the alphabet. This is not done here.
